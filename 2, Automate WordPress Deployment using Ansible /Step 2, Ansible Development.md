## BEGIN ANSIBLE DEVELOPMENT
1. In your ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository, create a new branch that will be used for development of a new feature.
2. Checkout the newly created feature branch to your local machine and start building your code and directory structure
3. Create a directory and name it playbooks – it will be used to store all your playbook files.
4. Create a directory and name it inventory – it will be used to keep your hosts organised.
5. Within the playbooks folder, create your first playbook, and name it common.yml
6. Within the inventory folder, create an inventory file (.yml) for each environment (Development, Staging Testing and Production) dev, staging, uat, and prod respectively.

- Set up an Ansible Inventory An Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. Since our intention is to execute Linux commands on remote hosts, and ensure that it is the intended configuration on a particular server that occurs. It is important to have a way to organize our hosts in such an Inventory.

Save below inventory structure in the inventory/dev file to start configuring your development servers. Ensure to replace the IP addresses according to your own setup.
Note: Ansible uses TCP port 22 by default, which means it needs to ssh into target servers from Jenkins-Ansible host – for this you can implement the concept of ssh-agent. Now you need to import your key into ssh-agent:

For Linux :
```
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add <path-to-private-key>
```
Confirm the key has been added with the command below, you should see the name of your key
```
ssh-add -l
```
Now, ssh into your Jenkins-Ansible server using ssh-agent
```
ssh -A ubuntu@public-ip
```
Also notice, that your Load Balancer user is ubuntu and user for RHEL-based servers is ec2-user.

Update your inventory/dev.yml file with this snippet of code:
```
[nfs]
<NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[webservers]
<Web-Server1-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
<Web-Server2-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[db]
<Database-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 

[lb]
<Load-Balancer-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ubuntu'
```
## # CREATE A COMMON PLAYBOOK

- Create a Common Playbook
It is time to start giving Ansible the instructions on what you needs to be performed on all servers listed in inventory/dev.

In common.yml playbook you will write configuration for repeatable, re-usable, and multi-machine tasks that is common to systems 
within the infrastructure.

Update your playbooks/common.yml file with following code:

```
---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      yum:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt repo
      apt: 
        update_cache: yes

    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      apt:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest
```



Examine the code above and try to make sense out of it. This playbook is divided into two parts, each of them is intended to 
perform the same task: install wireshark utility (or make sure it is updated to the latest version) on your RHEL 8 and Ubuntu 
servers. It uses root user to perform this task and respective package manager: yum for RHEL 8 and apt for Ubuntu.

Feel free to update this playbook with following tasks:

- Create a directory and a file inside it
- Change timezone on all servers
- Run some shell script
 
- Update GIT with the latest code
Now all of your directories and files live on your machine and you need to push changes made locally to GitHub.

Now you have a separate branch, you will need to know how to raise a Pull Request (PR), get your branch peer reviewed and merged to
the master branch.

Commit your code into GitHub:

1. use git commands to add, commit and push your branch to GitHub.

```
git status

git add <selected files>

git commit -m "commit message"
```


2. Create a Pull request (PR)

3. Wear a hat of another developer for a second, and act as a reviewer.

4. If the reviewer is happy with your new feature development, merge the code to the master branch.

5. Head back on your terminal, checkout from the feature branch into the master, and pull down the latest changes.

Once your code changes appear in master branch – Jenkins will do its job and save all the files (build artifacts) to 
/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/ directory on Jenkins-Ansible server.
